about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at [KNU Vision & Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kvl), receiving guidance from Prof. <mark>Heechul Jung</mark>. My current research interests focus on video recognition, domain adaptation, and time series analysis. Furthermore, I am also interested in applying these technologies to medical image analysis.

  Besides research, I am also interested in watching movies and playing games.
