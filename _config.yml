about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at [KNU Vision & Learning Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kvl), receiving guidance from Prof. <mark>Heechul Jung</mark>. My current research interests focus on Video Recognition, Domain Adaptation, and Timeseries Analysis. Furthermore, I am also interested in applying these technologies to Medical Image Analysis.

  Besides research, I am also interested in watching movies and playing games.
    - Harry Potter series
    - Teamfight Tactics
